# Agile Apes v2.7

## Description:
Agile Apes is a gamified learning app that aims to teach and subsequently test students on Agile application development.
The learning material includes content on Agile fundamentals and terminology.
The app implements an incentive based learning structure that rewards students with an in-game score which can then be
translated to tangible prizes (every 5 virtual bananas can be claimed for a real banana at participating stores).
The app also provides a learning component which allows students to learn the material before attempting the quiz. 

## Compatibility:
Works most efficiently on Pixel 2 API 28.

## Facebook Login:
With the implemented Facebook API, users must be invited by the developer to allow Agile Apes to access their Facebook account.
To allow any Facebook user to login through Agile Apes, a privacy policy must be designed and all of the apps features must be
available to the general public.
This was deemed impractical as the app is currently still in development and thus a dummy Facebook account with login
credentials was created to allow for testing of the API. The credentials are as follows:
Email: harry_fdfhcam_schrocksky@ftbnw.net
